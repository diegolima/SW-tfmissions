Following the capture of BFF-1 bulk freighter Onece 3, the Imperials realized that the Rebels would retaliate by destroying Outpost D-34, so they sent three TIE/LN starfighters from Alpha, Beta, and Gamma squadrons. They were to patrol the station and hold of any Rebel attack until the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Hammer, under the command of Admiral Flanken would arrive to relieve them. Flanken planned to not arrive until much later believing that the initial attack was either a feint or they're testing the situation, once they would commence the full force he would hit them with full power.
