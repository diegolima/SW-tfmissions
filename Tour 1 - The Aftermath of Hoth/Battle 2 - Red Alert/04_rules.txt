- Imperial Respawn: Whenever an player-controlled imperial miniature is destroyed it is not removed from the game. 
  Instead it is placed on its original starting location after 1 turn has passed since its destruction.

- Imperial victory timer (10 turns): At the end of turn 10 the Empire wins the game unless the Rebels have accomplished their mission goal.

- Rebel Reinforcements (Y-Wings - 1 wave): Whenever all player-controlled Y-Wing rebel miniatures are destroyed the game does not end.
  Instead they are all placed on their original starting location immediately after the last miniature is destroyed. They keep any upgrade
  cards they may have been carrying.
  This effect happens once and only if the reinforcement wave has not joined the game due to other effects.
